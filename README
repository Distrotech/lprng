                 LPRng - An Enhanced Printer Spooler
                  Patrick Powell <papowell@sdsu.edu>

The  LPRng  software  is an enhanced, extended, and portable  version
of the Berkeley LPR software.  While providing  the  same general
functionality, the implementation  is  completely new and provides
support for the  following  features:  lightweight  (no  databases
needed)  lpr, lpc, and lprm programs; dynamic redirection  of  print
queues; automatic job holding; highly verbose  diagnostics; multiple
printers serving a single  queue;  client  programs  do not need to
run SUID root;  greatly enhanced security checks; and a greatly
improved permission and authorization mechanism.

The source software compiles and runs on a wide variety of systems, and
is compatible with most PC and MAC based print spoolers that use the
LPR interface.

The package comes with filters for PostScript and HP printers, as well
as the usual 'dumb' printers.  Note that the filters supplied for the
HP printers do accounting,  and were developed to be used in an
Educational Environment,  where avoiding accounting procedures is quite
prevalent.

In addition,  there are simulation scripts for the UNIX SVR4 lp and
lpstat commands that provide basic functionality for systems which
require this interface.
