Please read the HOWTO in HOWTO/LPRng-HOWTO.html for answers to questions
and more information about LPRng.

The  LPRng  software  is an enhanced, extended, and portable
implementation of the Berkeley LPR print spooler functionality.
While providing the same interface and meeting RFC1179 requirements,
the implementation  is  completely new and provides support for
the  following  features:  lightweight  (no  databases needed) lpr,
lpc, and lprm programs; dynamic redirection  of  print queues;
automatic job holding; highly verbose  diagnostics; multiple printers
serving a single  queue;  client  programs  do not need to run SUID
root;  greatly enhanced security checks; and a greatly improved
permission and authorization mechanism.

The source software compiles and runs on a wide variety of UNIX
systems, and is compatible with other print spoolers and network
printers that use the LPR interface and meet RFC1179 requirements.

The package comes with filters for PostScript and HP printers, as
well as the usual 'dumb' printers.  Note that the PostScript and
HP filters do page counting and produce accounting information
accounting.  In addition, there are a wide variety of other filters
that can do page formatting, and produce banner pages.

For users that require compatibility with the SVR4 lp and lpstat
interface, lpr and lpq will simulate this interface, eliminating
the need for another print spooler package.  In addition,  a
publically available  PCNFSD server is distributed with LPRng, and
interfaces with the PC/DOS/Windows based NFS style print spoolers.

For users that require secure and/or authenticated printing support,
LPRng supports Kerberos V and/or PGP authentication methods.
Additional authentication support is extremely simple to add.

Finally, Astart Technlogies (http://www.astart.com) offers commercial
support for the LPRng software.
