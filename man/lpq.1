.SH DESCRIPTION
.I lpq
requests a status report from
.IR lpd (8)
on the specified printers or jobs.
.I lpq
invoked without any arguments
reports on the printer given by the default printer
(see
.B \-P
option).
The short (default) format simply lists
the printer, host, and numbers of jobs in the spool queue.
When using the long format (-l option),
for each job in a spool queue
.I lpq
reports the job identifier
which is generated from the user's name and originating host,
current rank in the queue,
the job number (which may be supplied to
.IR lprm (1)
for removing a specific job),
the job description information,
and the total size in bytes.
If there is an error or other problem with the job,
this information may be modified to reflect the problems.
In a spool queue,
Job ordering is a modified FIFO (First in First Out),
modified by the job class and priority information.
.PP
The following options are available.
.IP "\fB-A\fR"
Use authentication when sending requests to 
.BI lpd (1)
server.
.IP "\fB-D\fR\fIdebugoptions\fR"
Debugging is controlled using the
.B \-D
option. This accepts a comma-separated list of debugging
settings. These settings take one of two forms: 
.B facility=value , 
or
.B value 
to set an overall default value.
.IP "\fB\-P \fIprinter\fR"
The specific printer queue to list;
the default is (in order of priority)
the explictly specified -P value,
the environment variable PRINTER,
the first entry in the printcap information,
and the default_printer entry from the
configuration file,
and finally the hard coded (site dependent) default_printer
value.
Note that the special printer
.B all
has the same affect as the
.I \-a
option.
.IP "\fB\-V\fR"
Print version information.
.IP "\fB\-a\fR"
All printers listed in the
.IR printcap (5)
database are reported.
This list is generated by the server,
and may differ from what the user printcap information contains.
.IP "\fB\-l\fR"
Increase verbosity of the \fBl\fRong display format.
A single -l options selects a short verbose display,
multiple -l options increase the verbosity.
.IP "\fB\-L\fR"
Use maximum verbosity for the \fBl\fRong display format.
.IP "\fB-s\fR"
Display a short, single line status summary for each queue and subqueue.
.IP "\fB-t\fR\fIsleeptime\fR"
Forces
.I lpq
to periodically display the spool queues and then sleep
.I sleeptime
seconds between scans of the queue.
.IP "jobid ... all"
The options are followed by
a list of jobids which
are used to select jobs of interest.
A jobid can be a user name,
a job identifier,
a job number,
or a glob based pattern which will be applied to the
job identifiers.
The all keyword will display all jobs and is the default option.
.PP
The
.I lpq
will report the status of the spool queue (enabled for spooling,
disabled for unspooling),
and the absence of a server if unspooling is enabled.
The
.IR lpc (1)
command
.I "lpc start <printer>"
may be used to start the server if this is the case.
.SH FILES
.PP
The files used by LPRng are set by values in the
printer configuration file.
The following are a commonly used set of default values.
.nf
.ta \w'/var/spool/lpd/printcap.<hostname>           'u
/etc/lpd.conf		LPRng configuration file
/etc/printcap		printer description file
/etc/lpd.perms	printer permissions
/var/spool/printer*		spool directories
/var/spool/printer*/printer	lock file for queue control
/var/spool/printer*/control.printer	queue control
/var/spool/printer*/active.printer	active job
/var/spool/printer*/log.printer	log file
.fi
.SH "SEE ALSO"
lpd.conf(5),
lpc(8),
lpd(8),
lpr(1),
lpq(1),
lprm(1),
printcap(5),
lpd.perms(5),
pr(1).
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.nf
Most of the diagnostics are self explanatory.
If you are puzzled over the exact cause of failure,
set the debugging level on (-D5) and run again.
The debugging information will 
help you to pinpoint the exact cause of failure.
