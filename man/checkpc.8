.SH DESCRIPTION
.B Checkpc
is used to check for the existence and correct permissions of entries
in the
.I printcap
database.
It is useful when installing a new printcap database and cleaning up
existing printer spoolers.
.IP "\fB\-a\fI" 5
Do not create accounting files if the fix option has been specified.
.IP "\fB\-c\fI configfile" 5
Read the configuration from configfile.
.IP "\fB\-f\fI" 5
The fix flag will cause the checkpc program to try and fix
various files and permissions.
It does this in a simple minded manner,
and the program may have to be run several times until all permissions
are correct.
It also reports its actions.
.IP "\fB\-l\fI" 5
Do not create log files if the fix option has been specified.
.IP "\fB\-p\fI" 5
Print verbose printcap information.
Useful if interested in the printcap values.
.IP "\fB\-P\fI printer" 5
Process only the specified print queue
.IP "\fB\-r\fI" 5
remove junk or job files older than the age set by -A.
You must set the age to a non-zero value otherwise no files are removed.
.IP "\fB\-s\fI" 5
Do not create printer status files if the fix option has been specified.
.IP "\fB\-A\fI Age[DHMS]" 5
Report junk or job files older than age.
The age time can have a suffix
days (D)
hours (H),
minutes (M),
or
seconds (S);
default is days.
.IP "\fB\-C\fI" 5
Print verbose configuration information.
Useful if interested in the configuration or defaults.
.IP "\fB\-V\fI" 5
Toggle verbose mode.
.SH "ANNOYING FEATURES"
If the
.B \-f
(fix)
option is specified and you do not run this as root,
it will complain,
but attempt to carry out the operations.
Usually the 
.IR chown (5)
will fail,
but this is not serious.
.SH FILES
.PP
The files used by LPRng are set by values in the
printer configuration file.
The following are a commonly used set of default values.
.nf
.ta \w'/var/spool/lpd/printcap.<hostname>           'u
/etc/lpd.conf		LPRng configuration file
/etc/printcap		printer description file
/etc/lpd.perms	printer permissions
/var/spool/printer*		spool directories
/var/spool/printer*/printer	lock file for queue control
/var/spool/printer*/control.printer	queue control
/var/spool/printer*/active.printer	active job
/var/spool/printer*/log.printer	log file

.SH DIAGNOSTICS

Most of the diagnostics are self explanatory.

set the debugging level on (-D5) and run again.
The debugging information will 
help you to pinpoint the exact cause of failure.
