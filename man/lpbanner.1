.SH "HISTORY"
.LP
LPRng is a enhanced printer spooler system,
with functionality similar to the Berkeley LPR software,
and is derived from the PLP (Public Line Printer) software,
version 4.0.
LPRng has many advanced features, which are described in
.I "LPRng - An Enhanced Line Printer Spooler"
by Patrick Powell, San Diego State University (papowell@sdsu.edu),
et al.
It is available from
dickory.sdsu.edu:/pub/LPRng.
.LP
The LPRng software is based on PLP4.0,
supported and extended by Justin Mason (jmason@iona.ie),
which is available from ftp://ftp.iona.ie/pub/PLP4.0.
Justin greatly aided in the design and development of many of the
software features,
as well as contributing a large number of bug fixes,
design reviews,
and other suggestions.
