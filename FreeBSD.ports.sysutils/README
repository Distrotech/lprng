This is the PORTS directory corresponding to the /usr/ports/sysutils/LPRng
in the FreeBSD Ports install.

1. copy these files to another location:
   cp -r LPRng /.../mystuff
   cd /.../mystuff/LPRng
   
2. Edit the Makefile and update the version information.

3. make checksum
   make makesum
   make

   This will get the distribution and install it in the
   /usr/ports/distfiles directory and then calculate the
   checksum.  This will fail, and the make makesum will
   recalculate the right values.  Now the install will
   proceed correctly.
