<P>Printing is one of the essential services provided by computer systems.
Users want reliable and easy to use methods of printing
that require a minimum amount of effort to used and understand.
On single user systems with a directly attached printer they
perceive that the printing process is simply a matter of
<I>storing</I>
or
<I>spooling</I>
a file,
and then transferring it to the printer in a timely manner.
In the classical
<I>multi-user</I> systems,
each user expects to share a common printer with one or more users;
the print
<I>spooling</I>
system provides arbitration and sharing of the printer among the various users.
In a <I>network</I>
based multi-user system,
there may be one or more printers shared by multiple users on many different
systems.
The print <I>spoolers</I> will need to cooperate to provide print services to
the users in a simple an predictable manner.
<P>The LPRng print spooler software was developed to a flexible and scalable
approach to each of these printing problems.
It has been used since 1988 in extremely demanding
academic printing environments such as University of Minnesota, MIT,
and Rutgers,
commercial companies such as Dow Jones and Abbot Pharmaceuticals,
as well as being distributed with Linux, FreeBSD, and other systems.
Each of these environments has a unique set of problems,
demanding various configuration and administrative capabilities.
For example,
the simple single user system with a single or limited number of printers
requires easy configuration and simple diagnostic procedures,
while the network based printing system requires highly robust
error logging,
authentication,
and failover support.
<P>This document
is structured to first provide an overview of the LPRng printing system,
and then a
<EM>quickstart</EM> guide for single user systems with a simple printer.
This includes printer hardware and Operating System  specific setup descriptions.
Next,
more complex configurations are described,
and their management and configuration are outlined.
Next,
an extremely detailed description of the LPRng print spooling components
and their functionality is provided.
Finally,
an index to the various features and functions of LPRng is provided.
<H2><A NAME="secfeatures"></A> <A NAME="ss1.1">1.1 What is LPRng?</A>
</H2>

<P>LPRng is a print spooling system. It was designed to mimic the
Berkeley (University of California - Berkeley) Line Printers (LPR)
package, first found on Berkeley derivatives of the Unix operating
system.
LPRng will print a document with little or no knowledge of the content
or special processing required to print the document on a stand-alone machine
or in a distributed printing environment.
New (as compared to Berkeley LPR) features
include: lightweight <CODE>lpr</CODE>, <CODE>lpc</CODE> and <CODE>lprm</CODE>
programs, dynamic redirection of print queues, automatic job holding,
highly verbose diagnostics, load balancing queues; enhanced
security (SUID not required in most environments),
and easy configuration.
<P>LPRng started life at the University of Waterloo in 1986
as PLP (Public Line Printer), a replacement for the original BSD LPD code.
This was a one-shot effort by the author,
Patrick Powell,
to develop code that could be freely redistributed
without the restrictions of the BSD/AT&amp;T license
and would allow non-license sites to fix and patch problems that they were
having with print spooling.
From 1988 to 1992,
various individuals and groups added features, hacked, slashed, and modified the
PLP code, coordinated largely by Justin Mason (<CODE>&lt;jmason@iona.ie&gt;</CODE>),
who started the LPRng mailing list (see 
<A HREF="#maillist">More Information</A>).
<P>In 1992 while at San Diego State University
Prof. Powell redesigned and reimplemented the PLP code
and named the result LPRng.
The goals of the LPRng project were to build a server system that was as
close to user abuse proof as possible,
that would provide services limited only by the inherent capacities of the
support system,
RFC1179 compliant,
and with extensive debugging capabilities to allow
quick and easy diagnostics of problems.
Over the period from 1994-1999,
LPRng users have suggested extensions,
provided patches,
and added facilities.
<P>In early 1999
the code base for LPRng was reorganized in order to provide a common
method for running on non-UNIX platforms such as Microsoft Windows NT,
Apple Rhapsody, and embedded systems.
<P>As a side effect of this work,
many security problems that could develop were identified and steps
taken to ensure that they were not present in LPRng.
For example,
LPRng clients such as lpr, lprm, lpc, and lpq run as
ordinary users programs,
and even the lpd server can run as a user once a network port has
been opened.
Bounds checking is performed on all input and formatting (for example,
snprintf() rather
than sprintf() is used),
as well as other preventive measures where appropriate.
