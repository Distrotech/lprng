<P>This document is an attempt to provide some simple guidelines to set
up LPRng. It is aimed at system managers who want to replace their
vendor's printer daemon and its clients by LPRng.
<P>LPRng can be configured in many ways, making it suitable for a broad
range of applications. It has a large amount of options which are
explained in the extensive documentation.
<P>Despite (or due to) the extent of the documenting files, many new
users experience problems in setting up the package. One of the
reasons is that most of the LPRng documentation
assumed that you already have a
working knowledge of a BSD-style printer spooler.
<P>In this document,
I will first try to give some simple guidelines that
should enable you to put together a simple working configuration
without being overwhelmed by options.
Next, there are some detailed descriptions of the way that LPRng
does things.
Finally,
there are detailed discussions about various LPRng facilities that
try to encapsulate common configurations and operations
that administrators and users encounter.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
LPRng is a print spooling system. It was designed to mimic the
Berkeley (University of California - Berkeley) Line Printers (LPR)
package, first found on Berkeley derivatives of the Unix operating
system. The LPRng package supports users being able to print a
document with little or no knowledge of the content or special
processing required to print the document; on a stand-alone machine,
on a LAN, or remotely. New (as compared to Berkeley LPR) features
include: lightweight <CODE>lpr</CODE>, <CODE>lpc</CODE> and <CODE>lprm</CODE>
programs; dynamic redirection of print queues; automatic job holding;
highly verbose diagnostics; multiple printers per queue; and enhanced
security (SUID not required in most environments (Sun/Solaris is an
exception), improved file permissions, authorization checks, ...),
etc.

<P>Patrick Powell
(<CODE>&lt;papowell@astart.com&gt;</CODE>), the author of
LPRng, has the following comments:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>LPRng started life in 1986 as PLP (Public Line Printer),
a replacement for the original BSD LPD code.
This was a one-shot effort to develop code that could be freely redistributed
without the restrictions of the BSD/AT&amp;T license,
and would allow non-license sites to fix and patch problems that they were
having with print spooling.
(This was before the Free Software Foundation.)
From 1988 to 1992, various groups added features, hacked, and modified the
PLP code, coordinated largely by Justin Mason
(<CODE>&lt;jmason@iona.ie&gt;</CODE>),
who also started and sponsors the LPRng mailing list (see below).
<P>In 1992,  I redesigned and reimplemented the PLP code
and named the result LPRng.
The goals of the LPRng project were to build a server system that was as
close to user abuse proof as possible,
that would provide services limited only by the inherent capacities of the
support system,
RFC1179 compliant,
and with extensive debugging capabilities to allow
quick and easy diagnostics of problems.
Over the period from 1994-1997,
LPRng users have suggested extensions,
provided patches,
and
added facilities.
I have tried to incorporate these in a controlled and cautious manner.
<P>As a side effect of this work,
many security problems that could develop were identified and steps
taken to ensure that they were not present in LPRng.
For example,
if you want, you can run LPRng clients
such as lpr, lprm, lpc, and lpq as a non-privileged user;
this reduces the chances of users exploiting faults in the code and
gaining root privileges.
Bounds checking is performed on all input and formatting (for example,
snprintf() rather
than sprintf() is used),
as well as other preventive measures where appropriate.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>In most cases, LPRng is <B>not</B>
a drop-in replacement for BSD LPR. For most installations, you will
need adaptations.
However,
most of the changes are minor,
and many of the LPRng facilities are backwards compatible with
existing BSD print spooler facilities.
<P>
<A NAME="maillist"></A> <H2><A NAME="ss1.2">1.2 More Information</A>
</H2>

<P>Much of the material in the LPRng documentation has been
included in this document.
For example,
previous releases of LPRng had a large selection of README files;
most of these are now incorporated into the HOWTO document.
<P>Current information
about LPRng and the latest release
can be found on the LPRng web page:
<A HREF="http://www.astart.com/LPRng.html">http://www.astart.com/LPRng.html</A><P>There is also a mailing list at <CODE>lprng@iona.com</CODE>. To subscribe,
send an email to <CODE>lprng-request@iona.com</CODE>. The body should contain
only the word `subscribe'. To get off the list later on, repeat the
same procedure, but use the word `unsubscribe'.
<P>The LPRng distribution has a DOC directory that contains
several documents that are very helpful.
<B>DOC/Intro.ps</B> (Intro.txt for a slightly less readable text version) gives
an overview of the BSD/LPRng printing model,
and describes how LPRng carries out the printing process.
<B>DOC/Install.ps</B> (or Install.txt)
gives an overly detailed description of the LPRng installation and porting
procedures;  the README.installation file in the distribution is much shorter
and contains all of the information needed for the average installer.
The
<B>DOC/Tutorial.ps</B> (or Tutorial.txt) is a very short tutorial that
uses the non-privileged mode of LPRng which was designed for testing and
tutorial purposes.
<P>Several presentations of LPRng and print spooling software have been made
at the Large Scale Installation Administrator (LISA) conferences and
are in the LPRng distribution and available on web sites.
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.astart.com/pub/LPRng/LPRngLISA95.ps">LPRng - An Enhanced Printer Spooler System</A>
was presented at the LISA95 conference,
and is in the LPRng distribution as DOC/LPRng-LISA95.ps.
On a more general topic,
the slides for the LISA97 tutorial on
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.astart.com/pub/LPRng/LISA97.tgz">Printers and Network Print Spooling</A>
are also in the LPRng distribution in the DOC/LISA97 directory.
<P>The LPRng distribution also has a set of man pages (in the man/ directory)
that are the reference for the LPRng operation.
When in doubt, please consult them.
