<HR>
<H2><A NAME="s4">4. Installing the programs</A></H2>

<P>The basic components of the LPRng system are the executables
and the database files.
This section deals with generating and installing the executable
files.
<H2><A NAME="ss4.1">4.1 Files and Setup</A>
</H2>

<P>The LPRng system can run in several different manners.
However,
for most users it will require the executables
for the server <CODE>lpd</CODE>, and the client applications for
job submission - <CODE>lpr</CODE>,
job status - <CODE>lpq</CODE>,
job removal - <CODE>lprm</CODE>,
and server management - <CODE>lprc</CODE>,
and the <CODE>/etc/lpd.conf</CODE>
and <CODE>/etc/printcap</CODE> files.
<P>By default,
all the LPRng executables are installed in
<CODE>/usr/local/bin</CODE>,
which differs from other UNIX lpr systems,
which scatter them in various hidden and arcane locations.
<P>The
<CODE>
<A HREF="LPRng-HOWTO-7.html#lpdconf">/etc/lpd.conf</A></CODE>
file contains the configuration
information for the server and application programs.
The LPRng system has a compiled in set of defaults that should be
suitable for most user applications.
In fact,  the default
<CODE>/etc/lpd.conf</CODE> does not override any of the precompiled values.
<P>The
<CODE>
<A HREF="#printcapref">/etc/printcap</A></CODE>
file contains the printer database information.
This information can override the defaults in
<CODE>/etc/lpd.conf</CODE>
<P>By default,
the LPRng executables are installed in
<CODE>/usr/local/bin</CODE>.
Note that the BSD LPD executables are located in various places and will
need to be removed and renamed.
<H2><A NAME="ss4.2">4.2 Source Code and Installation</A>
</H2>

<P>If you have a binary distribution, you can skip this section. However,
since LPRng is a rapidly evolving package, I would advise you to check
whether there is a newer stable version available on one of the
<A HREF="LPRng-HOWTO-1.html#secftp">FTP sites.</A>
There should be a link to this stable version called
<CODE>LPRng-stable.tar.gz</CODE>.
<P>You should also look at the
<A HREF="#sysdep">System specific notes</A>
to see if there are any special things that you need to do for your system.
<H3>Building the software</H3>

<P>Before you start to build the software,
you should read the
<CODE>README.1st</CODE> and <CODE>README.installation</CODE>
files in the distribution.
If you have GNU Make, do:
<PRE>
./configure;
  #if you want internationalization,
  # ./configure --enable-nls
make clean all;
su   # you must do the following commands as root
make install
# if  you have not installed LPRng before,
# install default lpd.perms and lpd.conf file in /etc
if [ ! -f /etc/lpd.perms ]; then
    make default;
fi;
# update permissions,  create files needed for LPRng, check
# /etc/printcap file for problems.  Do as root:
./src/checkpc -f
</PRE>
<P>If you have BSD make do:
<PRE>
./configure;
  #if you want internationalization,
  # ./configure --enable-nls
make -f Makefile.bsd clean all;
su   # you must do the following commands as root
make -f Makefile.bsd install
# if  you have not installed LPRng before,
# install default lpd.perms and lpd.conf file in /etc
if [ ! -f /etc/lpd.perms ]; then
    make -f Makefile.bsd default;
fi;
# update permissions,  create files needed for LPRng, check
# /etc/printcap file for problems.  Do as root:
./src/checkpc -f
</PRE>
<P>Use the configure
<CODE>--bindir</CODE> option to specify
the location of the binaries,
or edit <CODE>src/Makefile</CODE> or
<CODE>src/Makefile.bsd</CODE>
after running configure.
The lines you have to change are:
<PRE>
INSTALL_BIN =     ${exec_prefix}/bin
# where daemons are installed: lpd
#INSTALL_LIB =     ${prefix}/lib
INSTALL_LIB =     ${prefix}/sbin
# where maintenance commands are installed: checkpc, setstatus
INSTALL_MAINT =   ${exec_prefix}/sbin
</PRE>
<P>By default, all LPRng executables are placed in
<CODE>/usr/local/bin.</CODE>
<H3>Problems with compilation</H3>

<P>If you have problems compiling the package, you can try these things:
<OL>
<LI>Try <CODE>gcc</CODE> instead of your vendor's C compiler.
This is the standard compiler used for LPRng.
Almost without exception,
if you have a ANSI C compatible compiler and libraries
a POSIX compatible standard set of system support routines,
LPRng will compile and run out of the box.
The main problems are with missing or modified system support routines,
but configure will usually detect this and set flags to use
suitable alternatives.</LI>
<LI>The <CODE>configure</CODE> and the <CODE>make</CODE> should be run on
the target host,
especially if the target host has a different version of the operating system.
This is extremely important for SunOS or Solaris,
where
there tend to be changes in the system's include files between
versions
as well as support libraries.</LI>
<LI><CODE>configure</CODE>
and the LPRng software tends to make the assumption that newer versions will not
have the same problems that older versions have had.</LI>
</OL>
<P>If you are not familiar with GNU configure, read the file
<CODE>INSTALL</CODE> for instructions.
<P>Also read the notes for your OS in section
<A HREF="#sysdep">System-dependent notes</A>
for specific installation help (if any).
<A NAME="installation"></A> <H2><A NAME="ss4.3">4.3 Preparing to run the daemon</A>
</H2>

<P>Don't be too impatient. Take your time to completely read through this
HOWTO. Things will be a lot easier when you first set up the
configuration files, and then start the new lpd.
<P>During the course of this steps, you will have to change some files.
Whatever you do: keep a copy of the original files!
<H3>Removing Existing Facilities</H3>

<P>Here is a summary and some scripts
to help you prepare your site for
running the server.
<OL>
<LI>Kill off the old server.
<PRE>
BSD:
  ps -aux |grep lpd
  kill (pid of lpd server)
System V or Linux:
  ps -ea |grep lpd
  kill (pid of lpd server)
</PRE>
</LI>
<LI>You should remove or rename the existing print system executables.
Use the following script and
examine the <CODE>/tmp/candidates</CODE> file for possible programs.
Remove or rename the non-LPRng versions of the programs.
<PRE>
# you might want to track down the old lpr, lpq, lprm binaries
find /usr -type file -name lp\* \; -print >/tmp/candidates
find /sbin -type file -name lp\* \; -print >>/tmp/candidates

# example rename
mv /usr/libexec/lpd /usr/libexec/lpd.orig
# example link
ln -s /usr/local/bin/lpd /usr/libexec/lpd
</PRE>
</LI>
<LI>Try starting and running <CODE>lpd</CODE> before permanently installing it.
You should do the next steps as <B>root</B>.
<PRE>
/usr/local/bin/lpd;    # start up LPD
lpq;    # test it with LPQ
</PRE>
</LI>
</OL>

<A NAME="startup"></A> <H3>Startup Scripts</H3>

<P>Don't forget to modify your system print startup files,
i.e. - the <CODE>/etc/rc</CODE> file in most BSD based UNIX systems,
or those in <CODE>/etc/init.d</CODE> on System V and Linux.
You will need to have them reference the LPRng <CODE>lpd</CODE>
and not the original system executable.
<P>Here is the core of a typical UNIX SystemV or LINUX startup file
that can be used to start up and shut down the server.
Note that you will most likely need to modify the
<CODE>echo</CODE> lines.
<PRE>
#!/bin/sh
case "$1" in
  start) # Start daemons.
    echo "Starting lpd: \c"; /usr/local/bin/lpd; bin/echo;
    ;;
  stop) # Stop daemons.
    echo "Shutting down lpd: \c"
    server=`/usr/local/bin/lpc -Pany@localhost lpd \
    | awk '{for(i=1;i&lt;=NF;++i){v=$i+0;if(v>1){ print v;exit;}}}'`
    if [ -n "$server" ]; then
      echo " server pid $server";
      kill $server;
    else
       echo " no server active";
    fi;
    ;;
    *)
       echo "Usage: lpd {start|stop}"
       exit 1

<A NAME="lpsimulation"></A> <H2><A NAME="ss4.4">4.4 Replacing UNIX SystemV lp, lpstat Printing Services</A>
</H2>

<P>Many UNIX utilities in the Solaris and HP UNIX environment use the
UNIX System V <CODE>lp</CODE> and <CODE>lpstat</CODE>
programs.
It is almost impossible to modify their operation to use the
LPRng <CODE>lpr</CODE> or <CODE>lpq</CODE> programs,
as they depend on various return codes and information.
<P>Here is Patrick Powell's comments on this:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
After fighting with LP simulation,  I finally decided to make the
interface part of the LPR/LPQ package.  If LPR is invoked as LP,
then it will 'act' like a 'semi-compatible' LP; similarly for LPQ and LPSTAT,
and LPRM and CANCEL.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>To get this functionality, you need to either make a symbolic link
or a hard link to the appropriate executable.
<PRE>
cd /usr/local/bin
ln -s lpr lp
ln -s lpq lpstat
ln -s lprm cancel
cd /usr/sbin
ln -s /usr/local/bin/lpr lp
ln -s /usr/local/bin/lpq lpstat
ln -s /usr/local/bin/lprm cancel
</PRE>
<P>See the man pages for lp, lpstat, and cancel in the LPRng/man directory.
Note that not all the functions of the original
lp programs are supported.
These man pages should be installed to replace the normal
lp, etc, man pages.
<P>For some purposes,  the rather rugged <CODE>lpstat</CODE>
simulation provided by this method does not work.
<A HREF="mailto:garrett@qualcomm.com">Garrett D'Amore &lt;tt>&lt;garrett@qualcomm.com&gt;&lt;/tt></A>

take a look at
<A HREF="http://people.qualcomm.com/garrett/">http://people.qualcomm.com/garrett/</A>
for details.
<A NAME="user"></A> 
<A NAME="group"></A> <H2><A NAME="ss4.5">4.5 Setuid ROOT and Security Issues</A>
</H2>

<P>By default,
LPRng executables are installed setuid ROOT.
When running,
they normally perform all operations with the user's effective UID,
and perform all other operations set to the user and group specified by the
<CODE>user=daemon</CODE>
and
<CODE>group=daemon</CODE>
printcap entries,
except for a very few places where they take extreme precautions against
actions that could cause security breaches,
change the EUID to ROOT,
and then immediately change back to the normal operation.
<P>As a scan of the various CERT Security Advisories will indicate,
many programs that run SUID root can be serious security loopholes.
While LPRng has been designed and implemented with security and
paranoia in mind,
there is still the possibility that user level or LPD processes
can have an exposed security loophole.
<P>To reduce the risk,
the user level utilities such as lpr, lprm, lpq, and lpc can be installed
non-setuid.
This effectively closes several possible security loopholes.
To install the executables as non-setuid,
the distribution <CODE>src/Makefile</CODE>
must have the following lines commented out,
and then LPRng reinstalled:
<PRE>
edit src/Makefile
   # comment out the next line to have LPRng installed non-setuid
   PERMS=$(SUID_ROOT_PERMS)
make install
</PRE>

<A NAME="sysdep"></A> <H2><A NAME="ss4.6">4.6 System specific notes</A>
</H2>

<P>The following are a set of suggestions and recommendations for
specific systems.
<A NAME="solarisinstall"></A> <H3>Solaris 2.4, 2.5, 2.6</H3>

<P>The Sun Solaris operating system is derived from the System V UNIX
baseline.
Use the following installation procedure.
<OL>
<LI>First,
install the LPRng software
and then rename all of the existing Solaris print facilities.
See the
<A HREF="#installation">Installation</A> section for details.
You should especially look out for
<CODE>lp</CODE>,
<CODE>lpstat</CODE>,
<CODE>lpsched</CODE>,
<CODE>lpadmin</CODE>,
and other executables used by Solaris for print support.</LI>
<LI>Next,
make sure you update the <CODE>/etc/rc</CODE> startup files.
During the startup or initialization,
Solaris will invoke a set of individual startup files.
You will find that the startupfile files are usually links to a
common one in the <CODE>/etc/init.d</CODE> directory.
<PRE>
># grep -l lpsched /etc/rc* /etc/rc*/* init.d/* init.d/*/*
/etc/rc0.d/K20lp
/etc/rc2.d/K20lp
/etc/rc2.d/S80lp
/etc/init.d/lp
># ls -l /etc/rc0.d/K20lp
lrwxrwxr-x  1 root  bin  1 Dec 29 23:39 /etc/rc0.d/K20lp -> ../../init.d/lp
</PRE>
</LI>
<LI>Replace the existing lp startup file with one similar to the
<A HREF="#startup">startup script</A> in the previous section.</LI>
<LI>Check the <CODE>/etc/inetd.conf</CODE> file for a line like:
<PRE>
printer stream tcp nowait root /usr/lib/print/in.lpd in.lpd
</PRE>

<P>and remove it if it is present.
You will need signal the <CODE>inetd</CODE> process to reread the
configuration file.
This is usually done using a <CODE>kill -HUP pid</CODE> command,
where <CODE>pid</CODE> is the <CODE>inetd</CODE> process id.
</LI>
<LI>If you don't want to reboot, you may need to use the nlsadmin(1M)
command to remove the network listeners on your printer port.  Even
after doing an lpshut, there is still a little devil hanging on.
For instance, on our systems it looked like so:
<PRE>
# nlsadmin -v tcp
lpd  \x00020203000000000000000000000000  ENABLED  \
  NORPC  root  NOMODULES  /var/spool/lp/fifos/listenBSD  #  
0  \x00020ACE000000000000000000000000  ENABLED    \
  NORPC  root  NOMODULES  /usr/lib/saf/nlps_server  #  
lp  NOADDR  ENABLED  NORPC  root  NOMODULES \
  /var/spool/lp/fifos/listenS5  #  
</PRE>

To remove them do:
<PRE>
# nlsadmin -r lpd tcp
# nlsadmin -r lp tcp
</PRE>
</LI>
<LI>You can then start lpd by typing
<PRE>
# /etc/init.d/lp start
</PRE>
</LI>
</OL>
<H3>Solaris, Newsprint and FrameMaker</H3>

<P>The following is a guide to using LPRng and
Sun Microsystems Newsprint by
Christopher Hylands, Ptolemy Project Manager
of the University of California.
<P>The Sun Newsprint printer is actualy
an OEM version of the  Textronix PhaserII;
Sun Microsystems appears to have dropped support for Newsprint,
and the recommended migration path is to buy a PostScript printer.
If you want more information on using the Newsprint system,
notes are available via
<CODE>http://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cxh/lprng.html</CODE>.
<P>Looking through the mailing list logs, it looks like everyone was
having a hard time getting lprng to work with Sun's braindead
newsprinters.  I tried using ghostscript, but the fonts were, IMHO,
ugly, so I spent a little time getting the newsprint fonts to work.
<P>The key thing was to grab the file
<CODE>/usr/newsprint/lpd/if</CODE>
from a SunOS4.1.3 newsprint installation.
If you cannot get this code,
then the installation will be extremely difficult.
<P>To install lprng on a Solaris2.x machine,
you need to first stop the existing print services and install the
startup scripts for LPRng.
Note that if there is a local printer, you may have
to also fix the permissions of the device. Typical commands are:
<PRE>
chown daemon /devices/sbus@1,f8000000/SUNW,lpvi@1,300000:lpvi0
</PRE>
<P>We use the following simple <CODE>if</CODE> script.
<PRE>
#/bin/sh
# extremely simple filter script
/bin/cat
</PRE>
<P>The Sparcprinters use licensed fonts from NeWSprint. To use the
licensed fonts, you must have the lprng spool directory for the
sparcprinter in the same location as spool directory of the brain
dead Solaris lp system.  If your printer is named xsp524, then this
directory would be <CODE> /etc/lp/printers/xsp524</CODE>.
<P>The printcap entry looks like:
<PRE>
sp524|524:
    :mx#0:sf:sh:sb:
    :lp=:rm=doppler:rp=xsp524:mx#0:
    :sd=/var/spool/lpd/sp524d:
    :lf=/var/spool/lpd/sp524d/log:
xsp524|Sun SPARCprinter NeWSprint printer:
    :mx#0:sf:sb:sh:rs:
    :lp=/dev/lpvi0:
    :sd=/etc/lp/printers/xsp524:
    :lf=/etc/lp/printers/xsp524/log:
    :af=/var/spool/lpd/xsp524/acct:
    :if=/usr/local/lib/newsprint/if:
</PRE>
<P>The
<CODE>/usr/local/lib/newsprint/if</CODE>
was copied from
<CODE>/usr/newsprint/lpd/if</CODE>
in a SunOS4.x installation of the newsprint
software.
Unfortunately, the newsprint engine is so brain dead that it
needs many environment variables set, so it is fairly difficult to
come up with a clean script to start the engine. I made the following
changes to the file.
<OL>
<LI>First, set the path in the script.
You may also need to change defaults to suit your preferences:
<PRE>
PATH=/usr/ucb:/usr/bin:/etc:/usr/etc:/opt/NeWSprint/bin:/opt/NeWSprint/np/bin:
PATH=$PATH:$NPHOME/pl.$ARCH/bin:$NPHOME/np/bin; export PATH
</PRE>
</LI>
<LI>You will also need a
<CODE>/etc/lp/printers/printername/.params</CODE>
file. If you
are using the same spooler directory as the directory that the Solaris
lp system uses, then the .param file should appear there. If you are
using a different spooler directory, then you will need to copy
the .param file from elsewhere and edit it accordingly.</LI>
<LI>If you are going to move a license to a new printer, you should
probably save the .param file in the old printer spooler directory.
Run /opt/NeWSprint/bin/fp_install and remove the license from the
old printer and assign it to the new printer.
You could run /opt/NeWSprint/bin/rm_np_printer and remove the printer,
but that will get rid of the .param file</LI>
<LI>FrameMaker under Solaris2.x uses the lp command. The fix is to edit
$FMHOME/fminit/FMlpr and comment out the lp line and add an lpr line
<PRE>
sunxm.s5.sparc)
    lpr -P"$PRINTER" "$FILE"
    #lp -c -d"$PRINTER" "$FILE"
</PRE>
</LI>

<H3>Linux</H3>

<P>At the time of writing (Jan 1998),
the three major Linux
distributions (Slackware, Red Hat and Debian) carry an older version
of LPRng. Users of those systems should download the
latest stable release, and install that instead of the distributed
binaries.
<P>This is mostly important for Slackware 3.2 users, as this version
installs LPRng by default.
Patrick Volkerding changed the default back to
BSD LPR in Slackware 3.3,
as many users had experienced problems
because they didn't realize they weren't using the BSD software.
<P>Debian's <CODE>dselect</CODE> utility lets you choose between all
packages. Amongst these are LPRng, as well as the traditional LPR
software.
<P>You have to make sure your kernel is configured correctly. The
documentation for the kernel sources in
<CODE>/usr/src/linux/Documentation/</CODE> and the <CODE>Kernel-HOWTO</CODE>
will help you to generate a new kernel if needed. You will need to set
the following options:
<UL>
<LI>Networking support (<CODE>CONFIG_NET</CODE>)</LI>
<LI>TCP/IP support (<CODE>CONFIG_INET</CODE>)</LI>
<LI>If your printer is connected to a parallel port, you will also
need the `Parallel Printer Support' (<CODE>CONFIG_PRINTER</CODE>).
You can use this as a module if you want.</LI>
<LI>For a serial printer, answer `Yes' when asked if you want
`Support for serial devices' (<CODE>CONFIG_SERIAL</CODE>). This is
also available as a module.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Once you have done this,
the current releases of LPRng will install and run without
problems.
See the
<A HREF="LPRng-HOWTO-3.html#installingprograms">Installing the programs</A>
section for details on how to install LPRng and
deactivate the existing print support.
<P>You may need to update the printcap file and filters.
See 
<A HREF="#printcapref">/etc/printcap Print Spool Database File</A>
for details.
<H3>AIX</H3>

<P>This information was supplied by
<A HREF="mailto:nitschke@math.unihamburg.de">Dirk Nitschke,</A>
as of August 1997,
and describes how to install the LPRng package on a workstation
running AIX 4.1.x and possibly 3.x.x as well.
Dirk would be interested in any comments or corrections.
<P>Printing on AIX systems is different. AIX provides a general
queueing facility and printing is only one way to use it. You submit a
print job to a print queue using one of the commands
<CODE>qprt</CODE>, <CODE>enq</CODE>. You can use the BSD or
System V printing commands <CODE>lpr</CODE> or <CODE>lp</CODE>, too. The
qdaemon watches all (general) queues and knows how to handle your
job. A (general) queue is defined in the file
<CODE>/etc/qconfig</CODE>. The format of this file is different from
the <CODE>printcap</CODE> format.
<P>OK, how to replace the AIX printing system? There is no group
<CODE>daemon</CODE> on AIX. Therefore you have to change the default
group for file ownership and process permissions. We decided to use
the <CODE>printq</CODE> group. The user <CODE>daemon</CODE> exists on
AIX but we have chosen <CODE>lpd</CODE> as the user who runs
<CODE>lpd</CODE> and all filters and owns the spooling directories.
You can change the values for <CODE>group</CODE>,
<CODE>server_user</CODE> and <CODE>user</CODE> in your
<CODE>lpd.conf</CODE> file or in the sources
<CODE>src/common/default.c</CODE>. This is an example for
<CODE>lpd.conf</CODE>:
<PRE>
# lpd.conf for AIX (change group, server_user and user)
group=printq
server_user=lpd
user=lpd
</PRE>

Compile and install the LPRng package. Create your
<CODE>printcap</CODE>, spooling directories, accounting and logfiles
and so on.
Don't forget to use
<A HREF="LPRng-HOWTO-10.html#checkpc">checkpc</A> to make sure that all the
permissions are set correctly and the necessary files
are created.
<P>Then stop all print queues defined on your workstation. Use
<PRE>
# chque -q queuename -a "up = FALSE"
</PRE>

for this (yes, blanks around <CODE>=</CODE> are needed).
<P>If you have local printers attached to your system you will have an
<CODE>lpd</CODE> running. Stop this daemon using SMIT (Print Spooling,
Manage Print Server, Stop the Print Server Subsystem). Choosing
<CODE>both</CODE> also removes <CODE>lpd</CODE> from
<CODE>/etc/inittab</CODE>. Maybe it's faster to do this by hand:
<PRE>
# stopsrc -p'pid of /usr/sbin/lpd'
# rmitab "lpd"
</PRE>
<P>Now delete all print queues (managed by qdaemon) defined on your
system. You can use SMIT for this or the commands
<CODE>{mk,ch,rm}que</CODE>, <CODE>{mk,ch,rm}quedev</CODE>,
<CODE>{mk,ch,rm}virprt</CODE>. The SMIT fast path is <CODE>smit
rmpq</CODE>.
<P>To start the new <CODE>lpd</CODE> at system startup you have to add
an entry to <CODE>/etc/inittab</CODE>:
<PRE>
# mkitab "lpd:2:once:/full/path/lpd"
</PRE>
<P>Some work has to be done if have have a local printer attached to
your workstation. You have to create a device file like
<CODE>/dev/lp0</CODE>. The SMIT fast path for this is <CODE>smit
mkdev</CODE>. Choose <CODE>Printer/Plotter</CODE> and then
<CODE>Printer/Plotter Devices</CODE>. Now <CODE>Add a
Printer/Plotter</CODE>. To create a parallel
printer device select the following:
<PRE>
Plotter type:              opp Other parallel printer
Printer/Plotter Interface: parallel
Parent Adapter:            ppa0 Available
</PRE>

Now define the characteristictics of the device:
<PRE>
Port Number: p
</PRE>

(<CODE>p</CODE> is for parallel).
Go to the field
<PRE>
Send all characters to printer UNMODIFIED   no
</PRE>

and select <CODE>yes</CODE>! We have had a lot of trouble with
<CODE>no</CODE>.  This is very important! Expect erroneous output if
you choose <CODE>no</CODE>. If you have already created a device

<H3>LPRng to Appletalk Printing</H3>

<P>The netatalk package comes with a PostScript filter called psf.  After
compilation, it is in (e.g.) netatalk-1.4b2/etc/psf and will be installed
in (e.g.) /usr/local/atalk/etc/.  After installation, there will also
be a directory /usr/local/atalk/etc/filters that contains ifpap, ofpap,
et al.  These are just symlinks to psf, and psf will do the appropriate
thing based on how it was invoked.  If there's a 'pap' in the name,
psf uses AppleTalk to talk to the printer.  See psf(8) for more information.
<P>A printcap entry for a network printer looks like the following:
<PRE>
dave|Dave's 32 Character Printer Name:\
    :sd=/var/spool/dave:\
    :lf=/var/adm/lpd-errs:\
    :lo=lock:\
    :if=/usr/local/atalk/etc/filters/ifpap:\
    :of=/usr/local/atalk/etc/filters/ofpap:\
    :lp=/var/spool/dave/null
</PRE>
<P>There are three caveats to using netatalk this way.
<OL>
<LI>The first is that
psf (i.e., the filters) need to run as root.  You can accomplish this
in one of two ways.  The first is to uncomment the following line in
src/Makefile and recompile:
<PRE>
# ROOT_CFLAG=-DROOT_PERMS_TO_FILTER_SECURITY_LOOPHOLE
</PRE>

<P>The filter lines then need to look like the following:
<PRE>
    :if=ROOT /usr/local/atalk/etc/filters/ifpap:\
    :of=ROOT /usr/local/atalk/etc/filters/ofpap:\
</PRE>
<P>The alternative is to make psf setuid root.  To minimize the risk,
you may want to make psf executable only by group daemon.  (I haven't
tested the first option.  I'm currently using the second option.)
<P>
</LI>
<LI>The second caveat is that each network printer needs a .paprc in its
spool directory.  For instance, /var/spool/dave/.paprc looks like this:
<PRE>
Dave's 32 Character Printer Name:LaserWriter@Your AppleTalk Zone
</PRE>

<P>See psf(8) and pap(1) for more information.
<P>
</LI>
<LI>The third caveat concerns the lp line in the printcap entry.  For a
single printer, this can be /dev/null.  If the host spools to more
than one AppleTalk printer, you shouldn't use /dev/null for lp.  You
should use mknod to create a null device for each printer.  See psf(8).</LI>

<P>
<H3>What is SMB</H3>

<P>This is a big question.
<P>The very short answer is that it is the protocol by which a lot of
PC-related machines share files and printers and other information
such as lists of available files and printers. Operating systems that
support this natively include Windows NT, OS/2, and Linux and add on
packages that achieve the same thing are available for DOS, Windows,
VMS, Unix of all kinds, MVS, and more. There is no reason why Apple
Macs and indeed any Web browser should not be able to speak this
protocol, and current development (in which the Samba team is heavily
involved) is aimed at exactly that. Alternatives to SMB include
Netware, NFS, Appletalk, Banyan Vines, Decnet etc; many of these have
advantages but none are both public specifications and widely
implemented in desktop machines by default.
<P>The Common Internet Filesystem is what the new SMB initiative is
called. For details watch
<A HREF="http://samba.anu.edu.au/cifs">http://samba.anu.edu.au/cifs</A>.
<P><B>WHAT CAN SAMBA DO?</B>
<P>Here is a very short list of what samba includes, and what it does.
<UL>
<LI> a SMB server, to provide Windows NT and LAN Manager-style file and print
services to SMB clients such as Windows 95, Warp Server, smbfs and others.</LI>
<LI> a Netbios (rfc1001/1002) nameserver, which among other things gives
browsing support. Samba can be the master browser on your LAN if you wish.</LI>
<LI> a ftp-like SMB client so you can access PC resources (disks and
printers) from unix, Netware and other operating systems</LI>
<LI> a tar extension to the client for backing up PCs</LI>
</UL>
<P>For a much better overview have a look at the web site at
<A HREF="http://samba.canberra.edu.au/pub/samba">http://samba.canberra.edu.au/pub/samba</A>
and browse the user survey.
<P>Related packages include:
<UL>
<LI> smbfs, a linux-only filesystem allowing you to mount remote SMB
filesystems from PCs on your linux box. This is included as standard with
Linux 2.0 and later.</LI>
<LI> tcpdump-smb, a extension to tcpdump to allow you to investigate SMB
networking problems over netbeui and tcp/ip.</LI>
<LI> smblib, a library of smb functions which are designed to make it
easy to smb-ise any particular application. See

<H3>Samba and LPRng</H3>

<P>The SAMBA code is very easy to configure.  See the SAMBA

# smb:lp=/dev/null:sd=/usr/spool/smb:sh:if=/usr/local/samba/smbprint

# The /usr/spool/smb/.config file should contain:
#   server=PC_SERVER
#   service=PR_SHARENAME
#   password="password"

# Set these to the server and service you wish to print to 
# In this example I have a WfWg PC called "lapland" that has a printer

<H3>Duplex Printing</H3>

<P>Duplex printing is when you print on both sides of a page.
Some printers which do duplex printing require that you
send them special commands to force this mode.  This is
usually done by the FILTERS.  The CTI-ifhp (for HP PJL printers)
and psfilter (for PostScript Printers) make a stab at sending
the PJL or PostScript commands to the printer.  Many people have
reported problems doing duplex printing,  so  here is a check
list.
<OL>
<LI>Make sure you have enough memory for the worst case
print job.  Usually the printer has to rasterize both
pages before it can produce an impression.  It may require
much more memory than you expect.</LI>
<LI>Check your printer manual to discover the EXACT form of the
<CODE>enter duplex mode</CODE> command and make sure that either the command
is part of the job (PJL language at the start of the job,
postscript header, etc), or that the filter generates the
correct form.
<P>Note there is a PostScript Printer Description file (PPD) for
most printers that support PostScript,  and they even have the
PJL and PostScript code for this in the PPD file.
</LI>
<LI>It has been observed that even with what would apparently be
sufficient memory,  that many duplex jobs print 'oddly',
that they are not aligned on the same side in the same way,
etc etc.  This may not be the fault of the software,  but of the
support for duplex operation.</LI>
<LI>Get the source code for psfilter or CTI-ifhp filter,  and modify the
appropriate lines to send the appropriate "turn on duplex" strings
to the printer.</LI>
</OL>
<P>I know this is painful,  but until there is a uniform way to get the
correct commands extracted from either PPD or some other database then
this appears to be the only way to do it.

LPRng has been tested on just about every version of UNIX that supports
POSIX capabilities,
and if it is having problems then most likely it is due to non-portability
issues.
However,
if you feel that your system is not POSIX compatible,
or you are having serious problems due to LPRng's use of the system facilities,
feel free to try the following tests.
<P>Needless to say,
if you identify problems,  please inform the developers and they will

<LI> Run <CODE>./checkpc -T /tmp/a</CODE>.
This will perform a limited set of tests of the LPRng functionality.
Note that some of them will fail as checkpc is not running SUID ROOT
and the <CODE>/tmp/a</CODE> is not a serial device.
ALL of the non-SUID related messages should indicate success.</LI>

<LI>Now run tests for serial line control and locking:
<PRE>
./checkpc -T /dev/ttya   # or an appropriate UNUSED tty device

<P>You most likely will have to attach a terminal or modem to the serial device

as most serial device drivers block when <CODE>DSR</CODE> is not enabled.
Check the messages concerning the <CODE>stty</CODE> actions.
Make sure that the appropriate changes have taken place.
<P>You may get errors about <EM>device lock</EM> failing.
This is due to whacko differences in the ways that different UNIX systems
(or versions of the same UNIX system) implement serial device locking.
My advice is to ignore this problem unless you INSIST on having multiple users
of the same serial printing port,
in which case you are asking for serious trouble,
and you are on your own.

problems.
