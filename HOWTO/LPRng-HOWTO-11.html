<P>The LPRng method for doing accounting is based on experiences in a
Academic environment,  where avoiding printing accounting procedures
has long been practiced.  While the LPRng procedures are not bombproof,
they do provide a wide range of facilities,  with various degrees
of trust built into them.
<H2><A NAME="ss11.1">11.1 Printer Accounting Reality Check</A>
</H2>

<P>The following was written
by Patrick Powell
<CODE>&lt;papowell@astart.com></CODE>
in response to the expressions of frustration
that are periodically vented in the
<CODE>
<A HREF="LPRng-HOWTO-1.html#maillist">lprng@iona.ie</A></CODE>
mailing list.
While this addresses the use of a particular set of printer filters,
i.e. - the
<A HREF="LPRng-HOWTO-6.html#ifhp">CTI-ifhp</A>
set,
the comments are appropriate to other issues.
<P>In Academic institutions, avoiding printing accounting has been
regarded as a challenge,  an ongoing game of fat cat and poor starving
mouse, between the Administration and the downtrodden, poor, overcharged
student.  The following is a lighthearted ramble down the dark lane of
printing accounting.
<P>We will disregard the fact that if most students put as much effort
into their studies as in finding ways to avoid accounting procedures
then they would be Rhodes Scholar material,  but I digress...
<P>The accounting procedures put into the LPRng and the hpif filters may
appear to be extraordinarily complex,  but believe me, they are not.
Firstly, we make the assumption that the printer has some sort of
non-volatile page counter mechanism that is reliable and impervious to
power on/off cycles.  Without this mechanism the enterprising student
ummm... user will simply turn off the printer.  Software that prescans
jobs for line counts and pages is notoriously unreliable,  given even
the most modest efforts of users to hide these procedures.   The cost
of running a PostScript simulator simply to do accounting has its
flaws; without ensuring that the simulator has all of the interesting
security loopholes closed, such as opening files, etc.,  it can become
a trap door to hell for the system administrator.
<P>Secondly,  we must make the assumption that the student... uhhh...
user will not be able to tinker with the page counter mechanism, i.e.-
they will not be able to roll back the odometer on the printer, FOR THE
DURATION OF A SINGLE JOB.  I will digress and point out that a student
actualy did this for a challenge;  it only took him a couple of weeks
of study and a fully equipped micrcontroller lab, and two (2) laser
printers which he ruined in the experiment.  HP was not amused when we
sent them back under warranty,  claiming that this our 'normal lab usage.'
<P>Lastly,  you should not mind a small amount of pilferage, or a few
pages here and there being charged to the wrong account.
<P><B>How Does It Work?</B>
<P>The basic mechanism the CTI/LPRng filter uses is to record the page
counter value at the start and end of each part of a print job. Each
record has the form:
<PRE>
start -ppagecounter -Ff -kjob -uuser -hhost -R... 
end  -ppages -qpagecounter -Ff -kjob -uuser -hhost -R...
</PRE>
<P>When we use the OF filter and/or banners,  we will see the
individual jobs bracketed by the OF filter records:
<PRE>
start -p100 -Fo -kcfA100taco -uuser -hhost -R...  
start -p101 -Ff -kcfA100taco -uuser -hhost -R...  
end  -p1 -q102 -Ff -kcfA100taco -uuser -hhost -R...  
start -p102 -Ff -kcfA100taco -uuser -hhost -R...
end  -p3 -q105 -Ff -kcfA100taco -uuser -hhost -R...  
end  -p5 -q105 -Fo -kcfA100taco -uuser -hhost -R...
</PRE>
<P>It should be clear from the above that all we need to do is to add up
the values for the -Fo (OF) filter lines and we are done.
<P>Unfortunately,  this is too simplistic.  If for some reason the job is
killed or terminates due to error conditions,  the OF filter may not
get to finish its work.  Thus,  we may see the following:
<PRE>
start -p100 -Fo -kcfA100taco -uuser -hhost -R...  
start -p101 -Ff -kcfA100taco -uuser -hhost -R...  
start -p110 -Fo -kcfA101taco -uuser -hhost -R...
</PRE>
<P>This is a clear indication that the user's job has been terminated.  In
this case we need to use the differences between pagecounters of the start
records to do accounting.
<P>There is a caveat to all of this;  that is the problem of the last dead
job in the list.  If the last line in the accounting file is:
<PRE>
start -p110 -Fo -kcfA101taco -uuser -hhost -R...
</PRE>

is the last job finished or did it abort?
<P><B>Who Used Up 2000 Pages of Paper Today?</B>
<P>Now we move on to the problem of real time accounting.  Due to limited
budgets, etc., many institutions would like to strictly enforce limits
on paper use by students. As jobs are printed their accounts should be
docked for the amount of paper use.  One way to do this is to have an
external accounting procedure update a shared database.  The CTI filter
has provision for a shell script to be called at the end of print job;
this is done by both the OF and IF filter.  Thus, we can blithely
assume that there is a central database carefully getting updates
from the LPRng software, probably from dozens of different printers,
and updating the accounting information.
<P>The first question to be asked is simple:  is this worth it?
Perhaps doing accounting as a batch job once an hour/four times
a day/once a day is cheaper than building an running such a database.
If it costs $5K/year for the database software, you might just consider
ignoring the 10,000 pages that get lost in the shuffle and use
a simple set of awk/sed/perl scripts to update a database once
an hour.
<P><B>BAD JOBS - Who Do We Bill?</B>
<P>We inevitably run into an interesting question:
what happens if a job does not complete correctly?
<P>If you use the completion of the OF filter as a success status, I have
to point out that many students... ummm... users soon find ways to send
jobs to the printer that will cause it to lock up after their output
has been printed. These jobs require power cycling of the printer and
restarting the filter; a bit extreme, perhaps, but it has happened.
<P>I suggest that you simply adopt a 'bill to last user of record'
attitude,  using the pagecount information as follows:
<PRE>
start OF -- starting point for THIS job
start IF --  nice information, but not useful
start IF --
end   OF -- ending point for this job - can record infomation
start OF --
if no end OF for previous job,  then treat as end OF and
      update accounting.
</PRE>
<P>Now somebody is sure to complain that they got charged for a bunch of
pages that they did not use.  This is inevitable;  always carry a
can of oil for the squeaky wheels.  I might make the observation that
once is accident, twice is coincidence, but three times is malice;
be wary of the constant complainer and check out not only him or her but
also their co-workers.
<P><B>How Do We Update the Database?</B>
<P>I suggest that database update be done as follows:
<P>You maintain a 'last page reported' counter for each printer in the
database.  When a successful job reports in,  check to see that<BR>
pagecount + joblength ==  newpagecount;
<P>If this is not the case,  then you have had a some unsuccessful jobs.
In this case I strongly recommend that you have a means to request the
accounting reporting program to go back through the accounting file and
find the last report for the page counter value and try to backtrack
through the accounting files.  The accounting file is one of the first
things to be attacked by students... Ummm...  users.  It should NOT be
kept on an NFS exported or mounted file system.  It should be
carefully pruned and copied, perhaps on an hourly basis.
<P>Now some administrators have fallen in love with network based printers;
do not believe ANYTHING that comes over a network connection without
some form of authentication;  PGP has some very nice Public Key
mechansims for handling this.  This is a major weakness in using a
database for keeping track of accounting - a weak authentication
mechanism may lead to denial of service attacks by students flooding
the database with bogus print usage reports;  suddenly NOBODY can print
and the administrator is driven to turning off accounting.
<P>Good luck.  I am never surprised when I encounter yet another wrinkle in
this area.

<H2><A NAME="ss11.2">11.2 How HP Printers Implement Page Counters</A>
</H2>

<P>The following is from
<A HREF="http://www.hp.com/cposupport/printers/support_doc/bpl02119.html">http://www.hp.com/cposupport/printers/support_doc/bpl02119.html</A><P><B>HP LaserJet Printer Family - Page Count</B>
<P>Description Of The Page Count Feature On HP LaserJet 4 Family
Printers
<P>All HP LaserJet 4/5/6 family printers have a page count feature
built into the firmware. However, this feature works differently
depending on which HP LaserJet printer is being used. The following
is a description of how the page count feature works for each
printer within the HP LaserJet 4/5/6 printer families.
<PRE>
HP LaserJet 4/4M printers
HP LaserJet 4 Plus/4M Plus printers
HP LaserJet 4P/4MP printers
HP LaserJet 4Si/4Si MX printers
HP LaserJet 4ML printers
HP LaserJet 5P/5MP printers
HP LaserJet 6P/6MP printers
</PRE>
<P>All of the above printers use the same method for keeping track of
the number of copies. There are really two different page count
values: Primary and Secondary values. Every time a page is printed,
whether it is an internal job (such as a self-test) or a standard
print job, the Secondary page count increases by one. This value
is stored in standard RAM. Once the Secondary page count value
reaches 10, the Primary page count will increase by 10. The Primary
page count value is stored in a type of memory called NVRAM
(Non-Volatile RAM). This is important, since NVRAM is not cleared
when the printer is powered off. Standard RAM, on the other hand,
is cleared when the printer is turned off or reset. Thus, the
Primary page count only increases in increments of 10.
<P>Example
<P>You have a brand new HP LaserJet 6P printer and you print a self-test
page. When you look on the test page for the Page Count value, you
will see that it says 1. Next, you decide to print a two page letter
and, after that, another self-test. The page count value now says
4. Internally, the printers Secondary page count (stored in RAM)
has the value of 4 while the Primary page count (stored in NVRAM)
still has the value of 0. Now, you turn the printer off, then back
on, and print another self-test. The page count value again says
1 since the previous value of 4, stored in RAM, was cleared when
the printer was powered off. Finally, print a ten page document
and then turn the printer off. Upon turning the printer back on
and printing out another self test, you see that the page count
value is 11.  Internally, the Secondary page count value is back
at 1 while the Primary page count value (stored in NVRAM) is 10.
Added together, you end up with the resulting value seen on the
self-test page.
<P>HP LaserJet 4L/5L/6L Printers
<P>The reason that the page count method for the HP LaserJet 4L/5L/6L
printers differ from that of the other printers is that the HP
LaserJet 4L/5L/6L printers do not have any NVRAM available. Thus,
no way exists for the printer to retain a page count value once
the printer is powered off. The HP LaserJet 4L/5L/6L printers have
only a single page count value that increases in increments of one
until the printer is powered off. At that point, the page count
value is reset and begins from 0 once again.

<H2><A NAME="ss11.4">11.4 Accounting File</A>

<P>The most common method of accounting is to record the start and end
times of a job and its size to the accounting file. A typical entry
for the printcap defaults are shown below.
<PRE>

</PRE>
<P>The <CODE>jobstart</CODE> and <CODE>jobend</CODE> lines are added by the LPD server,  as
specified by the <CODE>as</CODE> and <CODE>ae</CODE> printcap options;
the -b (byte count) indicates the numbers of bytes in the job.
<P>The <CODE>start</CODE> and <CODE>end</CODE>
lines are produced by the filters;
the of filter has an -Fo, and the if filter a -Ff entry.
The filters in the LPRng distribution produce the
indicated output format by default.
The -p value is the current value of a page counter device (if any),
and the -b value indicates the total number of pages used.
<P>It should be clear that a simple AWK or Perl script will be able to
process an accounting file and update accounting information for
accounting purposes;  the usual problems with truncation, time stamps,
etc., are left as an exercise for the system administrator.
<P>Note that the accounting file must exist; LPRng will not create it
(and also will not create the log file).  This prevents accidentally
growing log and accounting files.
<H2><A NAME="ss11.5">11.5 Remote Server Accounting</A>
</H2>

<P>To accommodate even more aggressive and centralized accounting,
a method to make a connection to a print server and send information
to the server has been provided as well.
If <CODE>achk</CODE> option is set,
it is assumed that the <CODE>af</CODE> entry specifies a connection to
server on a remote host.
The <CODE>lpd</CODE> server will send the <CODE>as</CODE> string to the server,
and then wait for a single line of text from the remote server.
If the first word on the return line is
<CODE>accept</CODE> or <CODE>hold</CODE>,
the job will be either accepted for printing or held.
Any other value will cause the job to be deleted.
<P>At the end of the job the <CODE>ae</CODE> string will be sent to the server.
No response is expected.  Example:
<P>
<PRE>
:af=accounting.site.com%2300,tcp
:achk
:as=starting
:ae=ending
</PRE>
<P>The port that the connection originates from will be in the range
set by the configuration or printcap
<CODE>
<A HREF="LPRng-HOWTO-14.html#originateport">originate_port</A></CODE>
option.
<H2><A NAME="ss11.6">11.6 Using Filters For Accounting</A>
</H2>

<P>Some sites have expressed interest in using a central accounting
mechanism to check that users have permissions.  This can be done by
using the an alternative form of the as (accounting start) and ae
(accounting end) printcap tags.  If the as and ae are filter
specifications,  then a filter is invoked.  If the as (accounting
start) filter returns a non-zero exit status,  then its value
is used to handle the job as indicated by
the
<A HREF="LPRng-HOWTO-6.html#termination">Abnormal Termination</A>
codes for filters.
At the end of the job the :ae: filter will be invoked in a similar manner,
but its exit status is ignored.
<P>When using an accounting filter,
the STDIN  is attached (read/write) to the accounting file or remote host
specified by the <CODE>af</CODE> printcap option,
STDOUT to the output device,
and STDERR to the log file.
The filter program would be invoked with the default filter options.
<P>For example, here is a sample entry to check and update accounting
<PRE>
printer
   :as=|/usr/local/lib/filters/accounting.pl start
   :ae=|/usr/local/lib/filters/accounting.pl end
</PRE>
<H2><A NAME="ss11.7">11.7 Accounting Utility accounting.pl</A>
</H2>

<P>In order to provide a framework for doing using the outlined accounting
methods,  the LPRng distribution
<CODE>UTILS</CODE> directory has a <CODE>accounting.pl</CODE> script.
This script does the following.
<OL>
<LI>It is assumed that the accounting filter is invoked with the
following printcap entry.
The start and end is used by the filter to determine at which point in
the accounting process it is invoked.
<PRE>
printer
   :as=|/usr/local/lib/filters/accounting.pl start
   :ae=|/usr/local/lib/filters/accounting.pl end
</PRE>
</LI>
<LI>It maintains the accounting file as a set of entries in the following format:
<PRE>
START [job identification]
start -pnn ...
...
end -pnn+pagecount ...
END -ppagecount [job identification]
</PRE>
</LI>
<LI>Each time the filter is invoked with the <CODE>start</CODE>
tags,
it will add a <CODE>START</CODE> record to the end of the accounting file.</LI>
<LI>When it is invoked with the <CODE>end</CODE> option,
it will update the accounting file and add an <CODE>END</CODE> entry.</LI>
<LI>It will handle aborted jobs by looking for jobs with have a <CODE>START</CODE>
entry and a following <CODE>start</CODE> line and assuming that they
progressed to the point of starting print operations,
i.e. - the printer page counter was accessed and reported.
It will then look for the next <CODE>START</CODE> entry with a
following <CODE>start</CODE> line,
and assume that the pages between the two points were used by the
aborted job.</LI>
</OL>
<P>Administrators can use this script as a starting point for more advanced
accounting.
For example,
rather than just recording the information,
at the job start the script can query either a local database
or a remote server to see if the user has permissions to access the printer.
At the end of the job or when an <CODE>END</CODE> line is written to the
accounting file,
the local database or remote accounting server can be updated.
