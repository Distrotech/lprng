      <h1 class="SECT1"><a name="AEN10515">20.3. Job is not in
      print queue, but it gets printed!</a></h1>

      <p>In the original BSD <b class="APPLICATION">lpd</b>
      implementation, the <b class="APPLICATION">lpr</b> program
      copied users files to a special spool queue directory, and
      then caused the <b class="APPLICATION">lpd</b> server to peek
      in the directory and print the files.</p>

      <p>This type of operation required spool directory space,
      special SETUID programs, and a slew of headaches in system
      security and management.</p>

      <p>The LPR, <b class="APPLICATION">lpq</b>, and other user
      programs in the <b class="APPLICATION">LPRng</b> suite use
      TCP/IP connections and transfer jobs directly to a <b class=
      "APPLICATION">lpd</b> server running on a remote host, or
      even the local host if appropriate. Note that this type of
      operation does not require a <b class="APPLICATION">lpd</b>
      server to run on each local machine. In fact, you can have a
      single host system performing all of your printing. This type
      of operation is very similar to a central mail server versus
      individual systems, each having their own mail server and
      queues.</p>

      <p>However, some users require or want their jobs to be
      spooled on the local host system, and then transferred to the
      remote printer. This is usually the case when some type of
      processing (filtering) is needed in order to print the job
      correctly. There are several methods that can be used to
      force this.</p>

      <p>Method 1: Explicit Printer Address</p>

      <p>You can force a job to be sent directly to the <tt class=
      "LITERAL">pr</tt> serviced by the <b class=
      "APPLICATION">lpd</b> server on <tt class="LITERAL">host</tt>
      by using the form:</p>

      <div class="INFORMALEXAMPLE">
        <a name="AEN10533"></a>
<pre class="SCREEN">
    lpr -Ppr@host file
</pre>
      </div>
      <br>
      <br>

      <p>You can also set the <span class="ACRONYM">PRINTER</span>
      environment variable to a similar form, and get the same
      effect:</p>

      <div class="INFORMALEXAMPLE">
        <a name="AEN10537"></a>
<pre class="SCREEN">
    PRINTER=pr@host; export PRINTER;
    lpr file
</pre>
      </div>
      <br>
      <br>

      <p>Method 2: User and Server Printcap Entries</p>

      <p>If you want to have the benefits of a printcap file, i.e.
      - you can use aliases or abbreviations for the names of
      printers, then here is a couple of hints. First, the <b
      class="APPLICATION">LPRng</b> software scans the <tt class=
      "FILENAME">printcap</tt> file for printcap entries, combining
      information for the same printer into a single entry.
      Information found later in the printcap file will override
      earlier information. In addition, you can tag entries as
      either being used for all utilities or just for the <b class=
      "APPLICATION">lpd</b> server. Here are a couple of
      examples:</p>

      <div class="INFORMALEXAMPLE">
        <a name="AEN10544"></a>
<pre class="SCREEN">
    # for all utilities
    pr:lp=pr@host
    # just for lpd
    pr:server
      :lp=/dev/lp
    # more information
    pr:check_for_nonprintable@
    # --- final result for LPR
    pr:lp=pr@host:check_for_nonprintable@
    # --- final result for lpd
    pr:lp=/dev/lp:check_for_nonprintable@
</pre>
      </div>
      <br>
      <br>

      <p>As you can see, the <tt class="LITERAL">server</tt>
      keyword indicates that the printcap entry is only for the
      server. The <b class="APPLICATION">lpr</b> utility will send
      the job to the host, while the <b class="APPLICATION">lpd</b>
      server will print it on <tt class=
      "FILENAME">/dev/lp</tt>.</p>

      <p>Note that the <tt class="LITERAL">lp=...</tt> information
      overrides the <tt class="LITERAL">:rp:</tt> (remote printer)
      and <tt class="LITERAL">:rm:</tt> (remote machine) fields if
      they are present.</p>

      <p>Method 3: Force sending to server on <tt class=
      "LITERAL">localhost</tt></p>

      <p>The <tt class="LITERAL">force_localhost</tt> printcap or
      configuration flag forces non-<b class="APPLICATION">lpd</b>
      applications to send all requests and print jobs to the
      server running on the local host.</p>

      <p>This method is similar to the previous one, but has the
      benefit that it can be configured as a global (i.e. - applies
      to all printers) rather than printer specific. You can put
      this in the <tt class="FILENAME">lpd.conf</tt> file for
      general application, or have a printcap entry of the
      following form:</p>

      <div class="INFORMALEXAMPLE">
        <a name="AEN10562"></a>
<pre class="SCREEN">
    # for all utilities
    pr:lp=pr@host:force_localhost
</pre>
      </div>
      <br>
      <br>

      <p>The <b class="APPLICATION">lpd</b> server will ignore the
      <tt class="LITERAL">force_localhost</tt> flag, and send jobs
      to the <tt class="LITERAL">pr</tt> queue on the <tt class=
      "LITERAL">host</tt> machine. However, the LPR, <b class=
      "APPLICATION">lpq</b>, etc., utilities will send their
      requests to the server running on the local host.</p>
