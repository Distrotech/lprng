##                  LPRng - An Enhanced Printer Spooler
##                     lpd.perms file
##                   Patrick Powell <papowell@astart.com>
## 
## Access control to the LPRng facilities is controlled by entries
## in a set of lpd.perms files.  The common location for these files
## are: /etc/lpd.perms,  /usr/etc/lpd.perms, and  /var/spool/lpd/lpd.perms.
## The locations of these files are set by the perms_path entry
## in the lpd.conf file or by compile time defaults in the src/common/defaults.c
## file.  In addition to the global permissions files,  each spool queue
## can also have a permissions file.  This file is searched when information
## or operations on a specific printer is requested.
## 
## Each time the lpd server is given a user request or carries out an unspooling
## operation,  it searches to the perms files to determine if the action
## is ACCEPT or REJECT.  The first ACCEPT or REJECT found terminates the search.
## If none is found,  then the last DEFAULT action is used.
## 
## Permissions are checked by the use of 'keys' and matches.  For each of
## the following LPR activities,  the following keys have a value.

## KEY:
##   JH = HOST          host in control file
##   RH = REMOTEHOST    connecting host name
##   JUSR = USER        user in control file
##   CUSR = REMOTEUSER  user from control request
##   JIP= IP            IP address of host in control file
##   RIP= REMOTEIP      IP address of requesting host
##   PORT=              connecting host origination port
##   CONTROLLINE=       pattern match of control line in control file
##   FW= IP of source of request = IP of host in control file
##   SA= IP of source of request = IP of host in control file
##   SU= user from request = user in control file
##   SA= IP of source of request = IP of host in control file FROM info
##   SV= IP of source of request = IP of server host or server Localhost
##   LPC= lpc command globmatched against values
##   AU= Authorization check on transfer
##       AUTH will match (true) if authenticated transfer
##       AUTHTYPE will match authentication type
##       AUTHUSER will match client authentication type
##       AUTHFROM will match server authentication type and is NULL if not from server
##       AUTHSAMEUSER will match client authentication to save authentication in job
## 
## Match: S = globmatch, IP = IPaddress[/netmask],
##   N = low[-high] number range, V= matching or compatible values
## SERVICE: 'X' - Connection request; 'R' - lpr request from remote host;
##    'P' - print job in queue; 'Q' - lpq request, 'M' - lprm request;
##    'C' - lpc spool control request;
## NOTE: when printing (P action), the remote and job check values
##   (i.e. - RUSR, JUSR) are identical.
## NOTE: the HOST, USER, SAMEUSER and SAMEHOST checks always succeed
##   when checking permissions for a spool queue;  they are active only when
##   checking permissions of a spooled job.  
## 
## The SAMEHOST match checks to see that one (or more) of the
##  IP addresses of the host originating the request are the
##  same as one or more of the IP addresses of the host whose
##  hostname appears in the control file.
## The SERVER match checks to see if one (or more) of the
##  IP addresses of the host originating the request are the
##  same as one or more of the IP addresses of the server or
##  match the localhost's  IP address.  Note that in IPV6, there may
##  be multiple IP addresses for a single host.
## The FORWARD checks to see that all of the IP addresses of the
##  IP addresses of the host originating the request are not the
##  same as one or more of the IP addresses of the host whose
##  hostname appears in the control file.  This is equivalent to
##  NOT SAMEHOST
## 
## The  special key letter=patterns searches the control file
## line starting with the (upper case) letter, and is usually
## used  with  printing  and  spooling  checks.  For example,
## C=A*,B* would check that the class information (i.e.- line
## in  the control file starting with C) had a value starting
## with A or B.
## 
## A permission line consists of list of tests and an a result value
## If all of the tests succeed,  then a match has been found and the
## permission testing completes with the result value.  You use the
## DEFAULT reserved word to set the default ACCEPT/DENY result.
## The NOT keyword will reverse the sense of a test.
## 
## Each test can have one or more optional values separated by
## commas. For example USER=john,paul,mark has 3 test values.
## 
## The Match type specifies how the matching is done.
## S = glob type string match
##     Format:  string with wildcards (*) and ranges
##              * matches 0 or more chars
##              [a-d] matches a or b or c or d
##     Character comparison is case insensitive.
##     For example - USER=th*s matches uTHS, This, This, Theses
##                   USER=[d-f]x matches dx, ex, fx
## 
## IP = IP address and submask.  IP address must be in dotted form.
##      Format: x.x.x.x[/y.y.y.y]  x.x.x.x is IP address
##              y.y.y.y is optional submask, default is 255.255.255.255
##      Match is done by converting to 32 bit x, y, and IP value and using:
##         success = ((x ^ IP ) & y) == 0   (C language notation)
##     i.e.- only bits where mask is non-zero are used in comparison.
##     For example - REMOTEIP=130.191.0.0/255.255.0.0 matches all address 130.191.X.X
##          
## N = numerical range  -  low-high integer range.
##      Format: low[-high]
##      Example: PORT=0-1023 matches a port in range 0 - 1023 (privileged)
## 
## The SAMEUSER and SAMEHOST are options that form values from information
## in control files or connections.  The GROUP entry searches the user group 
## database for group names matching the pattern,  and then searches these
## for the user name.  If the name is found,  the search is successful.
## The SERVER entry is successful if the request originated from the current
## lpd server host.
## 
## Note carefully that the USER, HOST, and IP values are based on values found
## in the control file currently being checked for permissions.  The
## REMOTEUSER, REMOTEHOST, and REMOTEIP are based on values supplied as part
## of a connection to the LPD server,  or on the actual TCP/IP connection.
##
## The LPC entry matches an LPC command.  For example LPC=topq would match 
## when an lpc topq command is being executed.  You must still have the
## SERVICE=C entry to trigger this action.
##
## Note: the SERVICE=R and SERVICE=P both check the LPR actions
## of sending a job.  However, SERVICE=R does it when the job is being
## sent to the LPD server.  Some LPD (and LPR) implementations cannot
## handle a job being rejected due to lack of permissions,  and sit in
## an endless loop trying to resend the job.  This is the reason for
## the SERVICE=P check.  You can accept the job for printing,  and then
## have the SERVICE=P check remove the job.
##
## NOTE: if you do not have an explicit ACCEPT SERVICE=P or
## DEFAULT ACCEPT action then your print jobs will be accepted
## and then quietly discarded.
## 
## Example Permissions
## 
## # All operations allowed except those specifically forbidden
## DEFAULT ACCEPT
## 
## #Reject connections from hosts not on subnet 130.191.0.0
## # or Engineering pc's
##   REJECT SERVICE=X NOT REMOTEIP=130.191.0.0/255.255.0.0
##   REJECT SERVICE=X NOT REMOTEHOST=engpc*
## 
## #Do not allow anybody but root or papowell on
## #astart1.astart.com or the server to use control
## #facilities.
##   ACCEPT SERVICE=C SERVER REMOTEUSER=root
##   ACCEPT SERVICE=C REMOTEHOST=astart1.astart.com REMOTEUSER=papowell
## 
## #Allow root on talker.astart.com to control printer hpjet
##   ACCEPT SERVICE=C HOST=talker.astart.com PRINTER=hpjet REMOTEUSER=root
## #Reject all others
##   REJECT SERVICE=C
## 
## #Do not allow forwarded jobs or requests
##   REJECT SERVICE=R,C,M FORWARD
## 

## You can make sure that connections come from a privileged port.
## Default is to allow them from any port so that non-setuid programs
#  can do printing.
