If LPRng is not activated at installation time,
to activate the LPRng printing system do the following:

On FreeBSD:
  set'lpd_enable=NO' and 'lprng_enable=YES' in /etc/rc.conf.
  The LPRng startup script is in /usr/local/etc/rc.d/lprng.sh

On NetBSD:
  set'lpd=NO' and 'lprng_enable=YES' (or lprng=YES) in /etc/rc.conf.
  The LPRng startup script is in /usr/local/etc/rc.d/lprng.sh

  If lprng_enable != NO then the LPRng lpd will run.

- run 'checkpc -f' to make sure that necessary files have been created

- reboot or kill the old lpd using 'killall lpd' and
  start the new one using '/usr/local/etc/rc.d/lprng.sh start'.

LPRng uses the printcap, lpd.conf, and lpd.perms configuration files
