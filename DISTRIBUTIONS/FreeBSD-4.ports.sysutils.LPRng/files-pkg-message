To activate the LPRng printing system do the following:

- set `lpd_enable=NO' in /etc/rc.conf.
  The LPRng startup script is in /usr/local/etc/rc.d/lprng.sh

- run checkpc -f to make sure that necessary files have been created

- reboot or kill the old lpd (`killall lpd') and
  start the new one (/usr/local/etc/rc.d/lprng.sh start)

LPRng uses the printcap, lpd.conf, and lpd.perms configuration files
