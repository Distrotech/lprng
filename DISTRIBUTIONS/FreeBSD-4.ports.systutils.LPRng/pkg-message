To activate the new printing system do the following:

- set `lpd_enable=NO' in /etc/rc.conf.
  The startup script for lprng is in /usr/local/etc/rc.d/lprng.sh

- run checkpc -f to make sure that necessary files have been created

- reboot or kill the old lpd (`killall lpd') and
  start the new one (`/usr/sbin/lpd')

- remember to adjust your aliases or your PATH to use the new programs
  They are in /usr/sbin and /usr/bin
  
LPRng uses /etc/printcap, /etc/lpd.conf, and /etc/lpd.perms
