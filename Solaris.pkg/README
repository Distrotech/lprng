This directory contains files needed to make a solaris package of LPRng.

To build a package you must first configure LPRng to live in /opt with:
	./configure --prefix=/opt/LPRng
After that you must build it as usual. When that is done you can
run 'make pkg' in this directory. This will generate a package which can
be installed on solaris workstations.
